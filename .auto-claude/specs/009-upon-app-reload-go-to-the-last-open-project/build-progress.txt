# Build Progress: 009-upon-app-reload-go-to-the-last-open-project

## Status: COMPLETED

## Completed Chunks

### chunk-1-1: Update project-store.ts to persist selectedProjectId (COMPLETED)
- Added localStorage key constant `LAST_SELECTED_PROJECT_KEY`
- Updated `selectProject()` to persist projectId to localStorage
- Updated `loadProjects()` to restore from localStorage with validation
- Falls back to first project if stored project no longer exists
- Committed: 43290a6

## Implementation Summary

The feature adds localStorage persistence for the last selected project:

1. **Persistence on Selection**: When `selectProject()` is called:
   - If projectId is provided, saves it to `lastSelectedProjectId` in localStorage
   - If projectId is null, removes the key from localStorage

2. **Restoration on Load**: When `loadProjects()` runs:
   - Reads `lastSelectedProjectId` from localStorage
   - Validates that the stored project ID exists in the loaded projects
   - If valid, selects the stored project
   - Otherwise, falls back to selecting the first project

## Manual Verification Steps
1. Open the app, select a project
2. Reload the app
3. Verify the same project is still selected
4. Select a different project, reload, verify new selection is preserved
5. If last project was removed, first project should be selected instead
